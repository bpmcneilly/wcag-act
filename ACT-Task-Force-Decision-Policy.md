# Proposed ACT Task Force Decision Policy

This document explains the decision process of the Accessibility Conformance Test Task Force of the AG Working Group, and the ACT Rules Community Group when operating jointly with the ACT Task Force (collectively identified henceforth as the "ACT groups"). Decisions on ACT rules made according to this policy are recorded in the <a href="/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/Rule_Publication_Tracking">ACT Rule publication tracking table</a> wiki page. The ACT groups follow the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document</a> regarding decisions. This document provides additional details specific to the ACT groups about our decision-making process and to facilitate later decisions by the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group.

## Goals

The ACT groups strive to reach consensus via unanimous agreement. In the course of establishing consensus, it is critical that all participants have the opportunity to express their views for consideration so that all relevant information can be used in arriving at a conclusion. Consensus indicates that a substantial number of individuals in the group support a proposal, and within the ACT groups consensus can be achieved through this process.

During the discussion of a topic, participants are welcome to raise objections freely to help ensure that all available information can be considered and contribute to the best possible decision. However, when all views raised have been considered and the facilitators indicate a discussion is approaching the decision point, objections should not be raised unless the individual strongly believes the decision is the wrong one in spite of discussion, and the individual cannot "live with" the decision. Compromise on points that the individual considers suboptimal but can "live with" is an essential part of group decisions that must meet various requirements.

## Procedures

1. For rule development, we follow the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag-act/blob/master/wcag-ruleset-review-process.md">ACT Ruleset Review Process</a> which is essentially
    1. The ACT groups use GitHub for submitting rules for consideration, showing surveys done on the submission, documenting issues found, and follow-up changes made to address the issues.
    2. The ACT TF discusses survey results in weekly meetings and opens an issue to track comments made in the survey.
    3. The ACT-R CG handles and resubmits the rule when it is deemed ready for another ACT TF review.
    4. The ACT TF tracks progress for all rules in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/conformance-testing/wiki/Rule_Publication_Tracking">Rule Publication Tracking table</a>.
2. Discussion on a topic proceeds until the facilitators believe that all points of view have been expressed and the group has considered the variety of information presented. 
    1. Discussion can take place in any of the  ACT group channels - including, but not limited to, email, surveys, GitHub pull requests, comment threads in GitHub issues or pull requests, and in teleconferences.
3. When the facilitators believe that the group is ready to come to a decision, they announce in the meeting there will be a Call for Consensus and an email is sent to the Task Force's mailing list. The call remains open for a minimum of two working days.
    1. The Call is open to responses from all group members.
    2. The Call will be for a single topic, though for ACT rules, may include multiple rules.
    3. The Call will include pointers to the current version of the rule, and will include pointers to the relevant discussion, resolved issues, pull requests, surveys, email threads, or meeting minutes to give the context of the decision being made.
    4. The results of the CfC is announced in the next ACT TF meeting after the CfC closes.
    5. Editorial issues do not require a Call for Consensus. Any concerns about what is deemed editorial can be brought to the attention of the chairs privately or in group communications (through email or in meetings).
4. Evaluating the Call for Consensus
    1. If no objections are received by the deadline, the draft decision becomes a formal decision of the task force.
    2. If objections are received but the chairs believe the objections have already been considered as far as is possible and reasonable, and the reviewers providing the objections can "live with” the decision, the draft decision becomes a formal decision of the task force.
    3. If objections are received that the chairs believe present substantive new information or if the chairs believe there is not a clear consensus in the task force, they will reopen the discussion, as detailed in section 3.3.4 of the Process Document (Reopening a Decision When Presented With New Information).
    4. If task force member(s) continue to disagree and the chairs do not believe it presents substantive new information, or it does not meet the criteria established for adding new normative content, the chairs may decide the draft decision becomes a formal decision of the Task Force despite the objection.
    5. If no objection is raised, the ACT Task Force facilitators ratify the decision by recording it on the ACT Rule Tracking page. Any related edits to documents are committed at that time.
    6. Decisions are made identifiable in meeting minutes, in the subject line of archived email message, and in comments in related GitHub issues, etc.
5. If an objection is raised after a decision is ratified, the ACT TF facilitators will evaluate the objection to determine whether to reopen the discussion and work to address the issue.
6. In the rare situation where a formal objection is raised, the task force Facilitators, AG Working Group Chairs, and staff contact(s) will come to an agreement about the issue and work to address the issue as described in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGArchiveMinorityViews">section 3.3.3 of the Process Document</a> (Recording and Reporting Formal Objections). The outcome may be to record a decision with objections per section <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#formal-address">3.3.2 of the Process Document (Formally Addressing an Issue)</a>.

## Related Policies

The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group as a whole uses its own decision policy. Consensus from the Working Group is required to publish normative content, and ACT Rules, and may be required to publish informative content, depending on the content and publication mechanism. The ACT TF uses its own decision policy to facilitate discussion and consensus within the ACT groups, and to substantiate its proposals to the AG Working Group when seeking Working Group consensus.

Other aspects of Consensus are defined in the Process Document, including Votes (section 3.4) and Appeal of a Chair’s Decision (section 3.5). If a participant believes the task force facilitators have not exercised sound judgment in following this policy, they should express their concern first to one of the ACT Task Force facilitators, escalating if needed to the AG Working Group chairs or the AG staff contact, and further escalating if needed to the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative Lead.

In all discussions, participants are expected to follow the W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, treating other participants with respect, acknowledging different perspectives, and respecting various communication styles.
